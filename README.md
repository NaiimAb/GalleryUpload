# GalleryUpload
Gallery App for Spark Company

The project is for Coding Exercise provided by Spark Company for Android Developer Role 
The project was to provide a gallery with an image upload feature. This exercise is mostly front end with a tiny bit of back end. 

In that project, both front and back end were developed for better quality of app 
The app was developed using Android Studio and MVVM Archticteur 
The Server was developed using PHP and MySql for Database storing 

App Requirements
For the image upload please provide:

- a gallery view of all previously uploaded images
- a button which can either request to take a picture, or upload from camera roll
- the ability to rotate or crop images

The Server script has been added to this github repository to see the script. However, the app is connected to my own website naiimab.me 
which has the script uploaded to it 

The app and server were tested before submiting the last commit to Github 

All steps are recorderd using Git 

Thank you
